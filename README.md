# Airplane Crashes Analysis Using Pandas & Python

## Project Overview
This project explores airplane crashes over the years using **Python and Pandas** to uncover trends, analyze fatalities, and identify key patterns in aviation accidents. By leveraging **data visualization and statistical analysis**, we gain insights into the causes and impact of air crashes.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Dataset
- **Source:** Contains historical data on airplane crashes, including **date, location, airline, fatalities, and crash summaries**.

## Key Analyses & Insights
✔ **Trend Analysis:** Examines the frequency of airplane crashes over time.  
✔ **Deadliest Years:** Identifies the years with the highest fatalities.  
✔ **Airlines with Most Crashes:** Highlights operators with frequent incidents.  
✔ **Common Causes:** Extracts keywords from crash summaries to reveal leading causes.  
✔ **Fatality Rates:** Analyzes the severity of crashes over different periods.  

## Tech Stack
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning & manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Text analysis for extracting crash causes
